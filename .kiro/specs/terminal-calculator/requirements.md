# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a versatile terminal-based calculator built in Python that accepts user input and performs basic mathematical operations. The calculator is designed with a modular architecture to allow easy extension of mathematical functions and future interface additions. It targets beginner-level programmers while maintaining clean, extensible code structure. The application will be developed and tested on macOS using Python 3.8+.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input mathematical expressions in the terminal, so that I can quickly perform calculations without opening a separate application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the calculator with `python calculator.py` THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and prompt for input
2. WHEN the user enters a mathematical expression THEN the system SHALL parse and evaluate the expression
3. WHEN the user enters "quit" or "exit" THEN the system SHALL terminate gracefully
4. WHEN the user enters an empty line THEN the system SHALL continue prompting for input
5. WHEN the calculator runs on macOS THEN it SHALL work correctly with the default Terminal application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), so that I can handle common mathematical calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters an addition expression (e.g., "5 + 3") THEN the system SHALL return the correct sum
2. WHEN the user enters a subtraction expression (e.g., "10 - 4") THEN the system SHALL return the correct difference
3. WHEN the user enters a multiplication expression (e.g., "6 * 7") THEN the system SHALL return the correct product
4. WHEN the user enters a division expression (e.g., "15 / 3") THEN the system SHALL return the correct quotient
5. WHEN the user enters a division by zero THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use parentheses in my expressions, so that I can control the order of operations in complex calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters an expression with parentheses (e.g., "(5 + 3) * 2") THEN the system SHALL evaluate operations inside parentheses first
2. WHEN the user enters nested parentheses THEN the system SHALL evaluate from innermost to outermost
3. WHEN the user enters mismatched parentheses THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear error messages when I enter invalid input, so that I can understand what went wrong and correct my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters an invalid mathematical expression THEN the system SHALL display a descriptive error message
2. WHEN the user enters unsupported characters THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating valid input format
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL continue running and prompt for new input
4. WHEN an error message is displayed THEN it SHALL be user-friendly and not show technical stack traces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calculator to have a modular Python architecture, so that I can easily add new mathematical functions in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the calculator THEN the system SHALL separate parsing logic from calculation logic using Python classes and modules
2. WHEN implementing the calculator THEN the system SHALL use a plugin-like structure for mathematical operations following Python best practices
3. WHEN adding new operations THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to existing code
4. WHEN the calculator is structured THEN it SHALL have clear separation between input handling, expression parsing, and calculation execution using appropriate Python design patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calculator to be designed for future interface extensions, so that I can later add GUI or web interfaces without major restructuring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the calculator THEN the core calculation engine SHALL be independent of the terminal interface
2. WHEN implementing the calculator THEN the system SHALL separate user interface logic from business logic using Python modules
3. WHEN the calculator is designed THEN it SHALL use Python abstract base classes (ABC) to define calculation contracts
4. WHEN future interfaces are considered THEN the current design SHALL not prevent easy addition of new interface types (tkinter GUI, Flask web, etc.)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a history of my recent calculations, so that I can reference previous results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters "history" THEN the system SHALL display the last 10 calculations and their results
2. WHEN the user performs a calculation THEN the system SHALL store it in the calculation history
3. WHEN the calculator starts THEN the history SHALL be empty
4. WHEN the history reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL remove the oldest entries to make room for new ones

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calculator to be compatible with Python 3.8+ and macOS, so that it runs reliably in the target development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator is implemented THEN it SHALL use only Python standard library modules or clearly documented dependencies
2. WHEN the calculator runs on macOS THEN it SHALL handle keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) gracefully
3. WHEN the calculator is tested THEN it SHALL work correctly with macOS Terminal and iTerm2
4. WHEN the calculator uses Python features THEN it SHALL be compatible with Python 3.8 and later versions
5. WHEN the calculator handles file operations THEN it SHALL work correctly with macOS file system permissions
